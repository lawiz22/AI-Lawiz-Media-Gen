feat(ui): Enhance Extractor Tools UX and Standardize Header Model Display (v1.55)

This release significantly improves the user experience within the Extractor Tools and ensures consistent feedback regarding the active AI model across the entire application.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Extractor Tools Grid Improvements:**
    *   **Hover Actions:** Added "Download" (supporting Image, Skeleton, and JSON formats) and "Save to Library" buttons directly to the thumbnail hover overlay. Users can now manage assets without opening the details modal.
    *   **Responsive Layout:** Fixed grid column sizing to prevent overlapping with the left-hand control column on smaller screens.
    *   **Modal UX:** Overhauled the details modal layout. The image and description columns now scroll independently, and action buttons are sticky at the bottom, ensuring they are always accessible regardless of text length.

*   **Header & Navigation:**
    *   **Unified Provider Display:** Updated the Header logic to correctly detect and display the active provider ('GEMINI' or 'COMFYUI') and the specific model name for *all* tabs, including "Extractor Tools" and "Group Photo Fusion".
    *   **Dynamic Badge:** The model badge in the header now dynamically updates based on the specific sub-tool or pose mode selected within the Extractor and Group Fusion panels.

*   **Under-the-Hood:**
    *   **MediaPipe Stability:** Added timeout and error handling to the MediaPipe initialization in `detectPosesInImage` to prevent the UI from hanging indefinitely if the model fails to load.
    *   **Version Bump:** Updated application version to 1.55.
