feat(ui): Standardize Past Forward UX and Fix Character Gen Stability (v1.56)

This release unifies the UI/UX of the "Past Forward" tab with the rest of the application and addresses stability issues in the Character Generator.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Past Forward Overhaul:**
    *   Removed custom "Polaroid" styling, animations, and non-standard fonts.
    *   Implemented the standard 2-column layout (Controls left, Results right).
    *   Replaced custom uploaders and buttons with the shared `ImageUploader` and standard Tailwind components.
    *   Results are now displayed in a standard grid with hover actions (Download, Save to Library, Regenerate).

*   **Character Generator Stability:**
    *   **Fix:** Resolved a state management bug where resetting options or switching tabs would revert the internal `geminiI2iMode` to 'general', causing the Character Generator to malfunction.
    *   **Fix:** Added exponential backoff retry logic to the Gemini service to handle 429 (Rate Limit) errors more gracefully during parallel character generation.

*   **Version Bump:** Updated to v1.56.
