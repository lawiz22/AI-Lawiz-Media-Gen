feat: Integrate Z-Image model, fix Library saving, and add Preset Manager

- **Z-Image Integration**:
  - Added 'z-image' to selectable workflows in `constants.ts`.
  - Implemented Z-Image workflow template with support for Unet, VAE, CLIP, and Shift parameter.
  - Added UI components in `OptionsPanel.tsx` for Z-Image model selection and Shift slider.
  - Added "Use Shift" toggle (`comfyZImageUseShift`) to optionally bypass the AuraFlow node.
  - Updated `LoraSettingsPanel.tsx` to filter LoRAs for Z-Image (matching "z-image", "z_image", "ZIT").
  - Enabled Sampler, Scheduler, and Seed controls for Z-Image.
  - Configured default parameters in `App.tsx` upon model selection.
  - Updated `comfyUIService.ts` to handle Z-Image workflow generation and prompt styling.

- **Library Saving Fix**:
  - Updated `LibraryPanel.tsx` to correctly display saved parameters for `qwen-t2i-gguf` and `z-image` models.
  - Added display fields for Unet, VAE, CLIP, Shift, and specific LoRAs in the library item details view.
  - Fixed issue where users could not see saved settings for these models, ensuring full parameter persistence visibility.

- **Preset Manager**:
  - Added Preset Manager to `ImageGeneratorHeader.tsx` allowing users to save and load generation parameters.
  - Implemented `PresetSaveModal` for naming presets.
  - Added `preset` type to `types.ts` and updated `libraryService.ts` to support preset storage.
  - Implemented logic to filter presets by model type and load them instantly.
  - Fixed bug in `App.tsx` where default parameters would overwrite loaded preset values.
  - Added **Delete Preset** functionality with a confirmation modal (`ConfirmationModal.tsx`).

- **Refactoring**:
  - Cleaned up `comfyUIService.ts` logic for model connection and shift parameter handling.
  - Updated `types.ts` with new Z-Image configuration fields.
