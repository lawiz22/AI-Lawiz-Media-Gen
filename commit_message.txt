feat(core): Migrate to Electron Desktop App (v1.57)

This major release converts the web application into a standalone Electron desktop application, enhancing local integration and security.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Electron Integration:**
    *   Wrapped the React application in an Electron container.
    *   Configured `main` and `preload` scripts for secure IPC communication.
    *   Added `electron:dev` and `electron:build` scripts for easy development and deployment.

*   **Local API Key Management:**
    *   Implemented secure local storage for the Gemini API Key using `electron-store`.
    *   Added a UI input in the **Settings** modal to manage the API key directly within the app, removing the dependency on environment variables.

*   **ComfyUI Optimization:**
    *   Disabled `webSecurity` (CORS) in the Electron main process to allow direct, unrestricted communication with local ComfyUI instances.

*   **Version Bump:** Updated to v1.57.
