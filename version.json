  "changes": "Overhauled the Pose Extractor for significantly improved reliability. It now uses a new 'Pose Transfer' AI technique with visual style references instead of text prompts, resolving common issues where the AI would incorrectly copy clothing instead of the pose. Users can now also upload their own custom mannequin image as a style reference."
